   - Implemented functional run the necessary script at the end of the 
 functional checkout and svnupdate. It may be useful for automating the 
 deployment site. For example, after filling sources to the site is often 
 necessary to fill the sql dump into the database on the hosting.

   - Removed references to storeFileLogs as a member variable - it's  
 now a local variable within getFileLogs() called $fileLogs
   - getFile() now checks if you are requesting a directory, and  
  will return false if you are.   
   - Added a new parameter to run getDirectoryTree non- recursively
